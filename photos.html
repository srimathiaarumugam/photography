                <h2>Landscape photography</h2>
                <h2> <p>Landscape photography is another way of saying scenic or environmental photography. It involves taking pictures of a natural scene – often large and grand, but sometimes smaller and more intimate – in a way that brings the viewer into a scene. Landscape photography is one of the most popular types today, spinning off several sub-genres such as storm photography, seascapes, and so on.</p></h2>

                <h2>Food photography</h2>
                <h2><p>Food photography has experienced a remarkable growth in popularity in recent years thanks to social media. Previously, it was essentially a sub-genre of commercial work – advertisements, cookbooks, menus, and so on – but it’s becoming more a part of documentary photography today.</p></h2>

                <h2>Still Life Photography</h2>
                <h2><p>Another broad style of photography is still life photography, taking pictures in a studio of a manufactured scene in order to look as good as possible. Although still life photography sometimes includes living things such as plants, I’m putting it under the “manmade objects” category because it can include almost anything.</p></h2>

                <h2>Architecture Photography</h2>
                <h2><p>The next type of photography on this list is also one of the most popular: architectural photography, including cityscapes and other details of buildings and construction. In many ways, architectural photography is like landscape photography, with practitioners of both genres often using tripods and careful post-processing techniques to accentuate their subject as best as possible. </p></h2>

                <h2>Abstract Photography</h2>
                <h2><p>Abstract photography doesn’t really fit into any of the other categories, because you can take abstract photos in many different genres! I’ve even seem some amazing abstract wildlife photos where the photographer deliberately uses motion blur to capture their subject while moving. That said, I personally love abstract landscape photography the most.</p></h2>
